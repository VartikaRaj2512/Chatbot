# 🤖 Chatbot: A Sequence-to-Sequence Conversational Agent with Attention Mechanism

Welcome to **Chatbot**, a sequence-to-sequence conversational agent built using TensorFlow 2.5 and deployed with a minimal Flask front end. The model leverages an **Encoder-Decoder architecture** with an **Attention mechanism** to facilitate a more dynamic conversation flow. This repository contains all the necessary files to train and run the chatbot locally.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 **Sequence-to-Sequence Model**: Implements an encoder-decoder architecture with attention for a more context-aware response generation.
- 🧠 **Attention Mechanism**: Allows the chatbot to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses.
- ⚡ **TensorFlow 2.5**: Built with TensorFlow 2.5, ensuring a flexible and scalable machine learning framework.
- 🌐 **Flask Front End**: A lightweight front end using Flask that generates a clickable link for accessing the chatbot after execution.
- 🗣️ **Conversational Dataset**: Trained on a small dataset, but capable of improved performance when retrained on larger datasets.
  
## 📂 File Structure

1. **`Run.py`** 🏃: This file launches the chatbot. Once executed, it generates a URL to initiate a conversation with the chatbot. Just click on the provided link to start chatting!  
   
2. **`model_train.py`** 🏋️‍♂️: This file is responsible for training the chatbot model sequentially. Make sure to use this file if you plan on training the model on new or larger datasets.  
   
3. **`chatbot.txt`** 📝: The dataset file used for training the chatbot. Feel free to explore or replace it with larger datasets for more robust training and improved results. Check out this larger dataset for better training: [Kaggle Chatbot Data](https://www.kaggle.com/fungusamongus/chatbot-data).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x 🐍
- TensorFlow 2.5 🧠
- Flask 🌐

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏃 How to Run

Follow these simple steps to start the chatbot:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot
   ```

3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python Run.py
   ```

4. A URL will be generated in the terminal. Click on the link to open the chatbot interface in your browser and start chatting! 🗣️💬

## 🧠 Model Training

To train the chatbot model on your own data:

1. Prepare your dataset and format it similarly to **`chatbot.txt`**.
2. Run the **`model_train.py`** script to train the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python model_train.py
   ```

For best results, it's recommended to train the model on a larger dataset, such as the one available on Kaggle: [Kaggle Chatbot Data](https://www.kaggle.com/fungusamongus/chatbot-data).

## 📊 Dataset Information

The chatbot in this repository is currently trained on a small dataset to demonstrate functionality. However, for better performance and more natural conversations, training on a larger dataset is recommended. Feel free to explore larger datasets like the one from Kaggle, or use your own conversational data.

## 📈 Future Improvements

🔮 Here are some enhancements that could take this chatbot to the next level:

- Train on larger datasets to improve response accuracy.
- Incorporate deep learning techniques like **Transformer-based architectures** (e.g., BERT, GPT) for even more advanced conversation capabilities.
- Expand the front end with a richer user interface for a more interactive experience.
